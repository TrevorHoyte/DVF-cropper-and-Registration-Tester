This code is designed to multiply a motion mask with a deformation vector field in order to essentially crop the Vector field.

Requirements:
-A Deformation Vector Field (DVF) , file should be mhd with a raw file.
-A motion mask of same dimensions as the DVF,(a binary image comprised of 1's and 0's) 
-FIJI can be downloaded here https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads


How To Run The Code:
-download the .class file 
-go into the fiji folder then go into the plugins folder and put the '.class' file in there
-restart Fiji
-In fiji go to plugins and select "DVF MASK Plugin "
-follow the instructions and Voila

The Code Registration Test is used to measure bead distance
-multiplies a registered image with a motion mask to keep only the important part of the image
-the code thresholds the result image to a highlight the high intensity structures ie the beads and mabny others parts.
-the code then saves a csv file containing every 3d object with their Center of mass and centroid position.

Use Registration_Tester_mha  when your registered image is in a mha format.
Use Registration_Test  when your registered image is in a mhd format.


Errors:
-If the code isnt working correctly follow the steps in the code manually 
then find what threshold and size of object is required for your image and then change them in the ".java" code and recompile.
-look at line 173 to change the threshold and size of object.



How To Run The Code:
-download the .class file 
-go into the fiji folder then go into the plugins folder and put the '.class' file in there
-restart Fiji
-In fiji go to plugins and select "Registration Test"
-follow the instructions and Voila

Note: Minimization code and minSTD do the same thing except minSTD calculates the Standard Deviation also

The code is supposed to be used with The Registration tester code.
Pre Requisits:
-you must find each and every point of intrest in your non registered image and record the center of mass of these structures in a 'Points.csv'file.
-make sure to follow the exact format of the file in this reppository or change the java code
-if not at least put the x,y,z in the 10th, 11th and 12th comma position respectively with the data starting at the 2nd line
-The points document shopuld contain the center of mass or centroid positions of all the structures of intrest to you.

What it does:
-the code simply goes through the "RegisteredPoints.csv" file crerated by the Registration tester code and matches the correct points to the points file
-it then records the Center of masses of the registered image as well as the L2 distance fromt he non registered points, as well as the average.
-The data is then saved in a file called FINALRESULTSMF.txt

How to Run it
-put the minimization.class, points.csv and the RegisteredPoints.csv in the same directory
-simply run the java code. in ubuntu the command is: java minimization
-there you go the results should be displayed in your teminal as well as in the created file.
